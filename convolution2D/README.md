# Convolution2D:
This project demonstrates convolutional image filtering using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. 
The program aims to perform convolution operations on images using custom kernels to achieve 
various image processing tasks like edge detection, blurring, sharpening, etc.

# Dependencies:
OpenCV: For image processing operations.
NumPy: For numerical operations on arrays.
Matplotlib: For image visualization.
Google Colab: For accessing Google Drive (if applicable).
Installation:
Ensure the necessary dependencies are installed. If running on Google Colab, follow the 
provided code cells to install dependencies and access image files.

# Usage:
Displaying and Loading Images:

The program provides functions to display and load images. Images are loaded using OpenCV 
and displayed using Matplotlib.
Main Convolution Function:

The convolve() function applies convolutional operations on input images using custom kernels. 
It computes the weighted sum of pixel values in the neighborhood defined by the kernel.
Example Kernel:

A sample kernel is provided in the code, which performs a basic edge detection operation. 
Users can define their custom kernels for different image processing tasks like blurring, 
sharpening, embossing, etc.
Executing the Code:

After defining custom kernels or using provided ones, execute the code to see the result 
of the convolution operation on the input image.
Sample Usage:
Load the image using the provided function.
Define or use pre-defined kernels.
Execute the convolve() function with the image and the kernel.
Display the original image, the kernel, and the resulting convolved image using the provided 
functions.
Important Notes:
Ensure the dimensions of the kernel are appropriate for the convolution operation.
Experiment with different kernels for various image processing tasks.
Understand the impact of different kernels on the resulting image.
Future Enhancements:
Addition of more complex image processing algorithms.
Integration with machine learning models for advanced image analysis tasks.
Implementation of real-time image processing capabilities.
