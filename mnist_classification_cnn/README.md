Introduction:
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It employs the Keras library, built on top of TensorFlow, for model creation and training.

Dependencies:
TensorFlow: The deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.
Keras: The high-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Loading and Preparing the MNIST Dataset:
The MNIST dataset is loaded using Keras, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9). The data is preprocessed, reshaped, and normalized for training the CNN model.

Defining the Neural Network Architecture:
The CNN architecture resembles LeNet-5, consisting of convolutional layers, activation functions, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model is compiled using the SGD optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.

Training the Network:
The model is trained over 10 epochs using the fit() method. Training and validation accuracy are monitored during the training process.

Visualizing the Network Performance:
The training history, including loss and accuracy curves for both training and validation sets, is visualized using Matplotlib.

Experiments:
Experiment with different filter sizes, increasing the number of filters, and exploring different pooling layers.
Modify the network architecture to achieve a twofold reduction of each feature map without using pooling layers.
Utilize the confusion matrix from scikit-learn to analyze which characters are frequently confused and provide insights into why.
Future Directions:
Experiment with advanced architectures like ResNet, VGG, or Inception for improved performance.
Explore techniques like data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization for better generalization.
Utilize transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models for faster convergence and improved accuracy.
