# Gradient Descent:
This project demonstrates the concepts of gradient descent optimization 
and the behavior of a sigmoid classifier using Python and visualization 
techniques. The code implements gradient descent for optimizing model 
parameters and visualizes the effects of different learning rates on the 
optimization process.

# Dependencies:
NumPy: For numerical computations and array operations.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.

# Gradient Descent:
The project provides a GradientDescent class that implements the gradient 
descent optimization algorithm. It includes functionality to set learning rate,
maximum iterations, epsilon for convergence, and recording history for 
visualization purposes.

# Sigmoid Classifier:
The SigmoidClassifier class implements a simple sigmoid classifier. It fits the 
model parameters using the gradient descent optimizer to minimize the logistic loss.

Usage:
Running Gradient Descent:
The code demonstrates the gradient descent process by optimizing the model parameters
of the sigmoid classifier.
Visualizing Learning Rate Impact:
The project visualizes the effect of different learning rates on the gradient 
descent process.
